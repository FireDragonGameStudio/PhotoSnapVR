# PhotoSnapVR
After Nintendo announced the new Pokemon Snap, I was wondering if a photography game would also work on Oculus Quest, with Hand-Tracking.

Guess what, it works pretty good :)

We've recorded a Youtube video to show you, how this prototype is intended to work: https://youtu.be/Ip_Xi02JMsw Feel free to fork it and create your own photography game.

We've also included our own recorded gesture data. Maybe this data can be useful for your own game/application with custom gestures.

Please note, that the music tracks used in our demos are from https://www.bensound.com
